Judging criteria
Each project will be ranked by our judges on the following 5 categories:

Technicality - What is the complexity of problem being addressed, or their approach to solving it?

Originality - Is the project tackling a new or unsolved problem, or creating unique/creative solution to an existing problem?

Practicality - How complete/functional is the project? Is it ready to be used by their intended audience?

Usability (UI/UX/DX) - Is the project easy to use? Has the team made good effort in removing friction for the user?

WOW factor - Catch-all for other factors the previous categories may have missed
